## How it works ##
  The Master branch is the starting point â€“ Initial state. You can watch the progress in the different branches by selecting the branch in github or if you cloned this repo by changing the branch.
  
  For each section is a separate branch. The interesting changes are happening in the webpack.config.js file. To see the webpack config in action you should run **npm run start** on a terminal to see webpack in action.
